## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least 16 years old to use the Service. By using Coworkers, you represent that you meet this requirement and that you have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.

If you are using the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.

## 3. Account Registration

### 3.1 Creating an Account

To use the Service, you must create an account using a valid email address. We use passwordless authentication—you sign in via a verification code sent to your email.

### 3.2 Account Security

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your email account and any devices where you use Coworkers. You agree to notify us promptly if you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account.

### 3.3 Insider Preview

## 4. Your Data

### 4.1 Local Workspace Data

Your workspace data—including co-workers, conversations, channels, threads, knowledge sources, and files—is stored locally on your device in a `.cowork` folder. You own this data. We do not have access to it except as described in Section 4.2.

You are responsible for backing up your workspace data. We are not liable for any loss of local data.

### 4.2 Data Transmitted to Cloud Services

When you use AI features, message content and conversation context are transmitted to our Cloud Services and routed to third-party AI providers for processing. See our [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for details on what data is transmitted and how it is handled.

### 4.3 Ownership of Your Content

You retain all rights to the content you create, upload, or input into Coworkers. We do not claim ownership of your content.

By using the Service, you grant us a limited license to transmit your content to third-party AI providers solely for the purpose of delivering the Service to you. This license terminates when you stop using the Service.

### 4.4 AI-Generated Content

Content generated by AI co-workers is provided to you for your use. You are responsible for reviewing, validating, and taking responsibility for any AI-generated content before relying on it or sharing it with others. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or suitability of AI-generated content.

## 5. Acceptable Use

You agree to use Coworkers in a manner that is lawful and respectful. You may not use the Service to:

- Violate any applicable law or regulation.
- Generate, store, or distribute content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable.
- Attempt to circumvent AI safety measures, content policies, or usage restrictions.
- Use the Service to develop competing AI products or to systematically extract AI model outputs for training purposes.
- Interfere with or disrupt the Service or its infrastructure.
- Impersonate any person or entity, or misrepresent your affiliation.

- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App, except as permitted by applicable law.
