# Review Coding Standards First

Before performing any task in this workspace:

1. **Read `docs/coding_standards.md`** (or re-read it if the task touches architecture, patterns, or conventions).
2. Apply the standards and patterns defined there—project structure, atomic composition, type safety, layer separation, SDK-first integration, error handling, and visual consistency.
3. When adding features, follow the documented flow: shared-services → API → app via IPC.

This ensures work aligns with the project’s production-grade standards and avoids drift.
