## Executive Summary

Coworker is a desktop-based AI workspace that transforms how individuals and small businesses work with artificial intelligence. Rather than forcing users to navigate fragmented tools, manage multiple subscriptions, and repeatedly re-explain context, Coworker delivers AI through the familiar structure of a team—with specialized co-workers, organized projects, and shared organizational memory.

Through a single subscription, users access multiple leading AI models without needing to understand their technical differences or manage separate accounts. The product's core innovation is not in the underlying AI, but in the **modality**—the human-centered design that makes AI feel collaborative, approachable, and intuitive.

## Problem Statement

Despite rapid advances in AI capabilities, most people find AI difficult to approach and integrate into their work. Current limitations include:

**Technical Friction**

- Users must choose between models without understanding their differences  
- Multiple subscriptions and accounts create administrative overhead  
- Prompt engineering skills are required for reliable results  
- Interactions are stateless, requiring constant context re-establishment

**Experience Gaps**

- Generic chat interfaces flatten all work into a single conversation window  
- No organizational structure for managing different projects or roles  
- Context and preferences must be repeatedly explained  
- AI feels like a tool to master rather than a team to collaborate with

**Market Fragmentation**

- Users must navigate an increasingly complex ecosystem of providers  
- No unified experience across different AI capabilities  
- Vendor lock-in concerns limit experimentation  
- Cost management becomes complex across multiple services

**Result:** AI remains "for experts" rather than accessible to everyday people building businesses, managing projects, or organizing their lives.

## Solution

Coworker provides a desktop application that organizes AI collaboration around three core constructs:

### 1\. **Workspace: Shared Context and Organizational Memory**

The workspace represents the user's life or organization as a whole, containing foundational information that every AI co-worker should understand:

- User identity, role, and objectives  
- Goals, constraints, and preferences  
- Company or brand information  
- High-level strategic priorities

This becomes persistent organizational memory—context that every co-worker automatically understands without repeated explanation.

### 2\. **Co-workers: Specialized Roles, Not Generic Bots**

Users create AI co-workers with specific roles and responsibilities, such as:

- Marketing specialist  
- Finance/operations manager  
- Product manager  
- Research or logistics coordinator

Each co-worker features:

- Specialized training and behavior appropriate to their role  
- Access to workspace-level context  
- Role-specific knowledge (e.g., brand guidelines, process documentation)  
- A designated AI model optimized for their function

Users assign the right intelligence to the right work naturally, without managing technical complexity.

### 3\. **Channels and Threads: Project-Based Collaboration**

**Channels** organize work around real projects, business functions, or ongoing initiatives. They act as containers of shared understanding where context builds over time.

**Threads** within channels enable focused collaboration sessions on specific topics or tasks, supporting workflows like:

- Drafting with a junior co-worker  
- Review and refinement with a senior co-worker  
- Iterative improvement based on feedback

This mirrors how real teams operate, making advanced AI workflows feel natural rather than technical.

## Target Users

**Primary:** Solo entrepreneurs, founders, and small business operators (1-10 person teams) who:

- Manage multiple business functions simultaneously  
- Lack resources for specialized staff in every area

- Want to leverage AI without becoming technical experts

**Secondary:** Knowledge workers and professionals who:

- Manage complex, multi-faceted projects  
- Require organization across different work streams  
- Value workflow continuity over individual task completion  
- Prefer collaborative experiences over transactional tool usage

## Strategic Positioning

### Core Belief

AI should not feel like a tool you have to learn.  
It should feel like a team you already know how to work with.

### Vision

Coworker aims to be the company that brings AI into people's lives the way Apple brought computing, music, and smartphones to the world—not by obsessing over the underlying technology, but by obsessing over **how humans experience it**.

**Coworker is the workspace for the AI era—where intelligence feels collaborative, approachable, and deeply human.**
