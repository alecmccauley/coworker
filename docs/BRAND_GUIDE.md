# Coworkers Brand Guide

## A Briefing for Everyone Building the Future of Work

---

We are not building software.

We are building the moment when AI stops feeling foreign and starts feeling familiar. When it stops being intimidating and starts being inviting. When people stop asking "how do I use this?" and start saying "I can't imagine working without this."

This is our iPod moment. And everything we build must honor that responsibility.

## The Moment We're In

Right now, AI is where MP3 players were in 2000\. The technology is incredible. The potential is obvious. The models are powerful and getting better every day. But for most people, engaging with AI feels like walking into a Radio Shack—overwhelming, technical, designed for people who already know what they're doing.

No one has made it *simple*. No one has made it *delightful*. No one has taken this extraordinary capability and wrapped it in an experience so intuitive, so obvious, so *human* that people just get it.

That's what we're here to do.

Apple didn't win by building the best processor. They won by understanding that people don't want to think about processors. They want to listen to music. They want to send a message. They want to get work done. The technology should disappear into the background, and the *experience* should feel like magic.

Coworker exists to do the same thing for AI.

We are not competing on which AI model is best. We are competing on whether someone's mother can use this. Whether a small business owner looks at it and thinks "yes, I understand this" rather than "I need to learn this." Whether someone *wants* it, not just needs it.

## Our North Star: The Familiar Made Powerful

Everything we build is guided by one principle:

**Make the extraordinary feel ordinary.**

The desktop metaphor worked because people already understood desks, files, and folders. The iPod worked because people understood playlists and albums. The smartphone worked because people understood making calls and sending messages.

Coworker works because people already understand *working with a team*.

We are not asking people to learn a new paradigm. We are taking the paradigm they already live in—the one where they have teammates with different specialties, where projects have structure, where context matters, where some conversations are quick and others build over time—and we are letting them bring AI into that world.

This is not a simplification. This is *clarity*.

A workspace is not a dumbed-down version of AI. It's the *right* version—one that mirrors how work actually happens. Co-workers are not a gimmick. They are how people naturally organize responsibility. Channels are not a feature. They are how projects stay coherent.

When someone opens Coworker for the first time, they should not feel like they're learning software. They should feel like they're being handed the keys to something they've been wanting but didn't know existed.

## The Emotional Experience We Create

Every interaction with Coworker should evoke three feelings:

### 1\. **Clarity, Not Complexity**

The world of AI is noisy. There are models, providers, subscriptions, capabilities, limitations, jargon, hype. People are tired of it.

Coworker cuts through all of that.

One subscription. One workspace. Co-workers who just work. No choosing between models. No figuring out which tool to use for which job. No re-explaining yourself every time you start a conversation.

When someone uses Coworker, they should feel a sense of *relief*. Like they've finally found something that isn't trying to impress them with how smart it is, but is simply trying to help them get their work done.

Clarity is not about being minimal. It's about being *obvious*. Every element, every interaction, every word should answer the question: "What do I do next?"

### 2\. **Partnership, Not Performance**

AI today feels transactional. You ask, it answers. You prompt, it generates. You get an output and move on.

That is not how people work. That is not how teams work.

Coworker should feel like *collaboration*. Like you're working *with* someone, not extracting something *from* them. When you engage with a co-worker, it should feel like you're delegating to a trusted colleague who knows the project, understands the context, and has the expertise to deliver.

This means our language is conversational, not robotic. Our interactions are warm, not clinical. Our co-workers remember what matters and don't make you repeat yourself.

People should feel like they have a team—not a tool.

### 3\. **Delight, Not Just Utility**

Coworker must be *wanted*, not just needed.

We are not building enterprise software that people tolerate because their company mandates it. We are building something people choose, recommend, and talk about. Something that makes them smile when it works exactly the way they hoped. Something that feels like a competitive advantage—like they've discovered something their peers haven't yet.

Delight comes from the small moments. The first time a co-worker references something you mentioned weeks ago in a different channel. The moment you realize you didn't have to explain your brand voice again. The experience of watching two co-workers collaborate on your behalf.

Our product should feel like a secret weapon that makes people better at their work—and makes work feel more human, not less.

## How This Shows Up in Everything We Do

Our brand is not what we say about ourselves. It's what people feel when they use what we've built. That feeling must be consistent across every touchpoint.

**In Our Product:**

- Every screen should be instantly understandable. If someone has to pause to figure out what something does, we've failed.  
- Every word matters. We use language real people use. No jargon. No cleverness for cleverness' sake. Just clarity.  
- Co-workers should feel like colleagues, not bots. Their tone, their helpfulness, their understanding of context should all reinforce the feeling of partnership.  
- Organization should feel natural. Workspaces, co-workers, channels, threads—the structure should mirror how people already think about work.

**In Our Communication:**

- We speak like humans, not like a company. We are direct, warm, and unpretentious.  
- We never talk about the technology unless it helps someone understand the value. Features are not our story. What people can *do* is our story.  
- We show, we don't tell. A single example of Coworker in action is worth a thousand words about capabilities.  
- We meet people where they are. We don't assume technical knowledge. We don't assume familiarity with AI. We assume intelligence and curiosity.

**In Our Design:**

- Simplicity is not plainness. It's intention. Every element serves a purpose. Every interaction has a clear reason to exist.  
- Beauty serves usability. We are not making art. We are making something people use every day, and it should be pleasant to use.  
- Consistency creates confidence. People should never wonder if something will work differently in a different part of the product.  
- Restraint is a feature. We add only what serves the user. Everything else is noise.

## What This Means for Everyone Building Coworker

If you are designing a feature, ask yourself: **Would my mother understand this without me explaining it?**

If you are writing copy, ask yourself: **Is this how a real person would say this, or is this how software talks?**

If you are building a workflow, ask yourself: **Does this feel like working with a team, or does this feel like operating a machine?**

If you are making a decision about what to include, ask yourself: **Does this make the experience simpler and more delightful, or does it just add capability?**

We are not optimizing for features. We are optimizing for *feeling*.

The feeling that AI is no longer something you have to learn, but something you already know how to use. The feeling that you've found something that finally makes sense. The feeling that work just got easier—and maybe even a little more enjoyable.

## Our Promise

When someone uses Coworker, they should feel like they've been handed something they didn't realize they were waiting for.

Not because it's flashy. Not because it's the most powerful. Not because it has the most features.

But because it's the first thing that *just makes sense*.

We are building the iPod for AI. That means we are relentless about simplicity. We are obsessed with the experience. We care more about how it feels than how it works. We design for delight, not just utility.

This is hard work. It's harder than building something complex and impressive. It requires saying no to good ideas because they don't serve simplicity. It requires discipline, restraint, and an unwavering focus on the person using what we build.

But this is how you change the world.

Not by building the most advanced technology.

By building the most human experience.
